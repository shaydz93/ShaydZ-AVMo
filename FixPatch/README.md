# ShaydZ AVMo Fix Patch

This patch fixes the "Invalid redeclaration of 'APIError'" and "APIError is ambiguous for type lookup in this context" errors in the ShaydZ AVMo project.

## How to Apply the Patch

1. **First, back up your existing files**

2. **Replace the following files with the ones from this patch:**
   - `Models/APIError.swift` - This is the central definition of the APIError enum
   - `Services/AppCatalogService.swift` - Fixed to remove duplicate APIError definition
   - `Services/AuthenticationService.swift` - Fixed to use the central APIError definition
   - `Services/NetworkService.swift` - Fixed to use the central APIError definition
   - `Services/VirtualMachineService.swift` - Fixed to use the central APIError definition
   - `ViewModels/AppLibraryViewModel.swift` - Fixed to use the central APIError definition

3. **Make sure the Models/APIError.swift file is added to your Xcode project:**
   - In Xcode, go to File > Add Files to "ShaydZ-AVMo"
   - Navigate to the Models folder and select APIError.swift
   - Make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked
   - Add to your main target

4. **Clean the project:**
   - In Xcode, select Product > Clean Build Folder (Shift+Command+K)

5. **Build the project:**
   - In Xcode, select Product > Build (Command+B)

## Key Changes Made

1. Created a centralized `APIError` enum definition in `Models/APIError.swift`
2. Removed duplicate `APIError` definitions from service and view model files
3. Added proper import statements to ensure the Models directory is in the search path
4. Fixed type references to use the central APIError definition

If you continue to experience issues, try the following additional steps:
1. Delete derived data folder: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
2. Restart Xcode
3. Ensure all files are properly included in your target's Build Phases
