# ShaydZ AVMo Project - Swift Compilation Fixes

This package contains fixes for the Swift compilation errors in the ShaydZ AVMo project. The main issues were:

1. Duplicate class declarations across files
2. Ambiguous type lookups for models

## How to Fix the Errors

### 1. Fix Duplicate Class Declarations

The project has multiple definitions of classes like `SupabaseAuthService` and `AppCatalogNetworkService`. 
We've renamed these using namespace prefixes and provided type aliases for backward compatibility.

### 2. Fix Ambiguous Type Lookups

For models like `SupabaseVMSession` and `VMStatus`, we've renamed them with namespace prefixes and made their properties and methods public.

## Files to Replace

Replace the following files in your project:

1. Replace `/ShaydZ-AVMo/ShaydZAVMoApp.swift` with `ShaydZAVMoApp-fixed.swift`
   - Removed duplicate service class declarations

2. Replace `/ShaydZ-AVMo/Models/SupabaseVMSession.swift` with `SupabaseVMSession-fixed.swift`
   - Added namespace prefix `ShaydZ_SupabaseVMSession` and made it public
   - Added type alias for backward compatibility

3. Replace `/ShaydZ-AVMo/Models/VMStatus.swift` with `VMStatus-fixed.swift`
   - Added namespace prefix `ShaydZ_VMStatus` and made it public
   - Added type alias for backward compatibility

4. Replace `/ShaydZ-AVMo/Services/AppCatalogNetworkService.swift` with `AppCatalogNetworkService-fixed.swift`
   - Added namespace prefix `ShaydZ_AppCatalogNetworkService`
   - Made all properties and methods public
   - Added type alias for backward compatibility

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to import the correct modules in your files
- If you encounter more ambiguities, follow the same pattern of namespacing and making classes/structs public
- Consider using modules to better organize your code and prevent naming conflicts

## Next Steps

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Replace the files as described above
3. Clean the build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder)
4. Build the project again

This should resolve the compilation errors related to duplicate declarations and ambiguous type lookups.
